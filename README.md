## Project info
# File Management with Doubly Linked List

This project provides a file management solution using a doubly linked list in C#. It allows you to read characters from a file, count their occurrences, and perform various operations such as traversals and sorting based on character value or frequency.

## Features

- Insert characters from a file into a doubly linked list
- Count the occurrences of each character in the list
- Traverse the list and display character counts and frequencies
- Sort the list by character value (ascending) or frequency (descending)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-management.git
   ```
2. Build the project
    ```bash
    cd file-management
    dotnet build
    ```
### Usage
1. Prepare a text file to analyze (e.g., file.txt) and ensure it exists.
2. Replace the path string in code to correspond to that text file:
   ```csharp
    string file = @"C:\tmp\file.txt";
   ```
3. The program will read the characters from the file, count their occurrences, and display the results.
